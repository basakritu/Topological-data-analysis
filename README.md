# Topological-data-analysis
Welcome to my Git repository for topological data analysis! In this repository, you'll find code and documentation related to the use of topological data analysis (TDA) in data science and machine learning.

Topological data analysis is a field of mathematics that applies algebraic topology to the analysis of data sets. It allows us to study the shape and structure of data sets in a way that complements traditional statistical methods. TDA has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its ability to extract insights from complex and high-dimensional data sets.
